Convenience script to load a database fixture that is located in the fixtures
folder of this ROS package. Typical use:

    rosrun openag_brain load_fixure <fixture_name>

Note: this command wraps the load_fixture command from the openag_python package.
If you want to load a fixture that does not live in the fixtures directory, you
can use the load_fixture command from the openag_python package:

    openag db load_fixture <path_to_fixture>
    """)
    parser.add_argument("fixtures", nargs="+")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    fixture_paths = resolve_fixtures(args.fixtures)
    for fixture_path in fixture_paths:
        print "Applying fixture {}".format(fixture_path)
        if subprocess.call([
            "openag", "db", "load_fixture", fixture_path
        ]):
            raise RuntimeError(
                "Failed to load fixture {}".format(fixture_path)
            )
